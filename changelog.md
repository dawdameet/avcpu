### **📝 Changelog: AI-Optimized Virtual CPU (avcpu)**  

#### **🚀 Latest Commit Changes**  
**(After Last Commit → Now)**  

✅ **AI-Powered Code Optimization:**  
- **Removed redundant MOV instructions** (e.g., `MOV R0, 5` → `MOV R0, 5` eliminated).  
- **Merged consecutive ADD operations** (e.g., `ADD R0, R1` → merged into a single operation).  
- **Eliminated useless JMP instructions** (e.g., jumps to the next instruction).  

✅ **Infinite Loop Detection & Prevention:**  
- **AI now detects execution loops and forcefully halts execution.**  
- **Prevents the execution count from increasing indefinitely.**  
- **Displays warning when an infinite loop is detected (`⛔ AI detected a persistent infinite loop`).**  

✅ **Enhanced AI Prediction Mechanism:**  
- **AI tracks execution count and predicts the most likely next instruction.**  
- **If a loop is detected in predictions, AI skips unnecessary jumps.**  
- **Avoids jumping between the same two instructions endlessly.**  

✅ **Performance Improvements:**  
- **Execution is now significantly more efficient due to AI-driven instruction optimization.**  
- **Reduced unnecessary operations, making the CPU execute fewer instructions for the same result.**

#### **📌 Previous Features (Before This Commit)**  
- Basic CPU execution with registers and memory.  
- AI-based execution path prediction.  
- Program loading and manual execution.  
- Basic instruction set (`MOV`, `ADD`, `JMP`, `HALT`).

### **🛠 Next Steps (Possible Future Upgrades)**  
- **AI Self-Learning Optimization** (AI adapts based on past executions).  
- **Dead Code Elimination** (AI detects and removes instructions that never execute).  
- **Dynamic Loop Unrolling** (Optimizing loops for faster execution).  
- **JIT Compilation** (AI recompiles and optimizes code at runtime).
