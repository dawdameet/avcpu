# **ðŸš€ Changelog - AI-Powered CPU Emulator**  
## **v1.1.0 - AI Execution Optimization & Learning (Latest)**
âœ… **AI Now Learns From Past Runs**  
- Execution history is now stored persistently across runs.  
- AI refines predictions based on previous execution data.  

âœ… **Infinite Loop Detection & Prevention**  
- AI detects and halts infinite loops dynamically.  
- Improved logging of detected loops and execution paths.  

âœ… **Performance Enhancements**  
- AI now **merges** execution data instead of **overwriting it**.  
- Optimized redundant operations (e.g., skipping repeated MOV, merging ADD).  

âœ… **Execution Data Persistence**  
- AI saves execution counts for each instruction.  
- Merged previous execution history with new data.  

## **v1.0.0 - Initial AI-Powered CPU Emulator**  
- Basic CPU execution with registers, memory, and instruction handling.  
- Added support for MOV, ADD, JMP, and HALT instructions.  
- AI implemented for execution path prediction.
