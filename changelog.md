# **🚀 Changelog - AI-Powered CPU Emulator**  
## **v1.1.0 - AI Execution Optimization & Learning (Latest)**
✅ **AI Now Learns From Past Runs**  
- Execution history is now stored persistently across runs.  
- AI refines predictions based on previous execution data.  

✅ **Infinite Loop Detection & Prevention**  
- AI detects and halts infinite loops dynamically.  
- Improved logging of detected loops and execution paths.  

✅ **Performance Enhancements**  
- AI now **merges** execution data instead of **overwriting it**.  
- Optimized redundant operations (e.g., skipping repeated MOV, merging ADD).  

✅ **Execution Data Persistence**  
- AI saves execution counts for each instruction.  
- Merged previous execution history with new data.  

## **v1.0.0 - Initial AI-Powered CPU Emulator**  
- Basic CPU execution with registers, memory, and instruction handling.  
- Added support for MOV, ADD, JMP, and HALT instructions.  
- AI implemented for execution path prediction.  


### **📝 Changelog: AI-Powered CPU Emulator**  

#### **🚀 Major Updates**  
✅ **1. Assembly Language Support** – Users can now write code in a separate `.asm` file instead of directly providing opcodes.  
✅ **2. Label-Based Jump Support** – Implemented labels (`LOOP:`) in assembly, replacing manual memory addresses.  
✅ **3. AI Execution Tracking** – The CPU now tracks execution counts and patterns to optimize future runs.  
✅ **4. Persistent Learning** – Execution data is stored in a local JSON file to improve AI-based optimizations.  
✅ **5. Infinite Loop Detection** – AI detects loops in execution (`JMP X` ↔ `JMP Y`) and halts when necessary.  
✅ **6. AI-Powered Optimization** – AI removes redundant MOV/ADD instructions and merges similar operations.  
✅ **7. Self-Healing Code (In Progress)** – CPU dynamically modifies its own instructions to optimize execution flow.  

#### **🔧 Fixes & Improvements**  
🔹 Fixed parsing errors in the assembler (comma handling, incorrect parsing of operands).  
🔹 Resolved infinite loop cases by adding smarter AI-based halting conditions.  
🔹 Improved the Makefile with proper targets (`assemble`, `main`).  
🔹 Reduced redundant jump predictions to avoid unnecessary AI recalculations.  
🔹 Fixed incorrect register value accumulation in loop-based programs.  

#### **🛠️ Next Steps**  
🔜 Implement **Self-Healing Code** (AI-driven instruction rewriting).  
🔜 Enhance **AI Branch Prediction** to optimize jump execution.
