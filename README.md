### **AI-Powered CPU Emulator – README (Updated)**  

## **Overview**  
This project is an **AI-optimized CPU emulator** that interprets a custom **assembly language** and dynamically **modifies itself for optimization**. The system includes:  
- **Assembler**: Converts `.asmcpu` assembly files into binary format.  
- **CPU Emulator**: Executes binary instructions with **AI-driven optimizations**.  
- **Self-Healing Code**: Detects inefficiencies and modifies instructions during runtime.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Uses execution history to identify patterns and redundant code.

## **🛠 Features**  

### 🔥 **New Technical Additions**
1. **🚀 AI-Driven Optimization**  
   - Detects redundant MOV instructions and removes them.  
   - Auto-loop unrolling for small loops.  
   - Identifies frequently executed sequences and optimizes branching.  

2. **📊 Statistical Execution Modeling**  
   - Tracks probability distribution of executed instructions.  
   - Uses historical execution data to predict inefficiencies.  
   - Stores execution patterns in `execution_data.json` for learning.  

3. **🔄 Self-Healing Code**  
   - Modifies the binary file dynamically to eliminate unnecessary instructions.  
   - Writes optimized code back to disk after execution.  

4. **🧠 AI-Powered Assembler**  
   - Detects and removes unnecessary MOV and ADD operations.  
   - AI-suggested optimizations annotated in `.asmcpu` files.  

5. **⚡ Multithreading (Rayon-Powered)**
   - Pattern recognition runs in parallel for faster execution.  
   - Execution profiling happens concurrently with program execution.

## **🚀 Usage**
### **Compile & Run**
```sh
make assemble      # Assemble program.asmcpu -> program.bin
make main          # Run AI-powered CPU emulator
```

### **Example Assembly Code (`program.asmcpu`)**
```assembly
MOV R1, 4
MOV R1, 4  ; AI will remove this redundant line
MOV R2, 9
MOV R2, 9  ; AI detects duplicate assignments
MOV R0, 2
ADD R1, R0
HALT
```

### **AI Execution Output**

## **📌 Real-World Use Cases**
1. **AI-Based Compiler Optimization**  
   - Can be extended to optimize real-world assembly code automatically.  
2. **Low-Level AI-Enhanced Code Execution**  
   - Conceptually similar to JIT compilers but at an **assembly level**.  
3. **Self-Healing Systems**  
   - Used in OS kernels to **dynamically patch inefficiencies** at runtime.  
4. **AI-Optimized Virtual Machines**  
   - Can be used for **AI-enhanced emulation** in security research & malware analysis.
